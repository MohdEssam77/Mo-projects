Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

a big difference in the real time starts to occur when the N gets really large. there is no difference when N was 10 or 100.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 10000
